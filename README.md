# overwolf-elo-overlay
This app creates an overlay for competitive games showing your ELO over the screen. The idea is to support every competitive game with an ELO system in it, but initially, it will support only League of Legends.

- have options to customize and hide/show stats related to ELO (name, LP, picture, etc).
- Choose to show over your screen gameplay or only on "tab" key action.

The idea came up when I was using the Outplayed recorder app. I realized that when I was saving my highlights (not many tho haha) I wasn't able to show the ELO that play was happening. I went to overwolf and could not find any overlay that could do that, so why not create it? It can be an app itself, or maybe an integration of any game recording app.
